To run the project, just open the starb-client.html file in your browser (preferably chrome) and follow the instructions on the screen.
In the input box, either enter a string that can be parsed into a puzzle, or leave it blank and
the default puzzle will be rendered.
A parsable puzzle is in the form "number|letters\n... Bank: words" (you don't need the quotation marks)
An example is "0|hi\n1|he\nWord Bank:hi\nhe\n", which represents a 2x2 board
where the first row has the letters h and i, and the second row has the letters h and e.
The word bank for this board consists of "hi" and "he".
